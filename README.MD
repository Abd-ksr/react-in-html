# React code in HTML using CDN

In this repo, we'll demonstrate how to write React code without the need to install any libraries or use create-react-app, by utilizing CDN script files instead.

## Without Babel 
We will not use Babel to compile the JS code.
`createElement` allow to create a React element and serves as an alternative to using JSX.

### Example
1. [React in HTML without Babel] (https://github.com/Abd-ksr/react-in-html/blob/main/react-in-html-without-babel/react-element-in-HTML-without-babel.html)
2. [React in HTML without Babel(Children)]  (https://github.com/Abd-ksr/react-in-html/blob/main/react-in-html-without-babel/react-element-in-HTML-without-babel-with-children.html)

## With Babel 
Here we are JSX and need Babel to compile the JS code.

### Example
1. [React function component in HTML]  (https://github.com/Abd-ksr/react-in-html/blob/main/react-in-html-with-babel/react-function-in-HTML.html)
2. [React class component in html] (https://github.com/Abd-ksr/react-in-html/blob/main/react-in-html-with-babel/react-class-in-HTML.html)
